## About Jonathan Kaonga

Aspiring to become a full-stack developer, I am fueled by the dynamic nature of web development and the boundless possibilities it offers. I thrive on collaborating with like-minded professionals to brainstorm innovative features and discover robust solutions.

I specialize in front-end development, crafting pixel-perfect UIs that not only look good but also have features that elevate user experiences.

I'm currently improving my TypeScript skills by following Matt Pocock's [Total TypeScript](https://www.totaltypescript.com/) and learning Unit Testing with Nathan Krasney's [Real World TypeScript Unit Testing](https://www.udemy.com/course/real-world-typescript-unit-testing/).

I have the legal right to work within the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. Opportunities beyond these regions will need a visa sponsorship or be 100% remote.

Beyond coding, I'm a dance and travel enthusiast. Exploring diverse cultures fuels my creativity, enriching my approach to web development.

Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!
